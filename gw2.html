        This is the second run of the same Nightfall however there is a very good reason for that. This is a run very close to my heart for multiple reasons. I obtained this record with 2 of my close friends, Niyr and Sith. Niyr had actually only ever ran one GM before and Sith was completely fresh to it.
        Glassway had since become a staple in GM speedrunning as the hardest and most fun run, so whenever it was available I was most definitely running it.

        Now in the previous two runs I have showcased they were both done with the same two teammates, Sequ and Crysis. The reason for this run consisting of an entirely different team is sadly due to the fact that sequ had passed away due to cancer at the age of 19.
        Sequ was one of my closest friends and despite him being over a thousand miles away I still shared an incredibly meaningful friendship with him. Myself and my team set out to run Glassway in what would be my final GM speedrun as a sort of last hurrah.
        The time obtained still stands as the fastest time ever to complete the whole strike, there has been a time that is faster than ours put out however it was utilising a glitch to skip some bosses - which is totally fine and within the rules - however no one has came close to our full run.
        We donated all the money from this video to a charity close to sequs family and it has been the last time I have touched a GM, hence its significance to myself.
