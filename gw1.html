    <p>When the Glassway was released in Destiny, even before the GM difficulty was added to it we knew it would be the hardest of them all. So of course, once the difficulty was added we set out to set the fastest time we could. We skipped the first day due to school however we gained a lot of information from other teams.
        It seemed as if the average time of completion was clocking in between 45 minutes and an hour. After our first day of runs we managed to get a time of around 19 minutes which was already 
        far ahead of the second fastest time. I recall saying to a friend of mine, whom I considered to be the best player in the game, that I reckon we could get below 15 minutes. He laughed and immediately shut it down.

        We ended the first week with a 14:52 (later retimed to 14:28 which rubbed even more salt into the wound of my friend) a time that was a whole 4 minutes faster than 2nd place. An incredible feat that I am very proud of.
