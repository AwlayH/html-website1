        This was my first run with Silimar. Silimar were an already established speedrunning group, arguably the best so to join them was extremely validating.
        You might notice that some of the runs say "2.8.0+", this is because after the 2.8.0 update a specific piece of tech we used had been removed. 
        This was extremely controversial to the community and it was widely criticized. A lot of the community believed the times before this patch would be unbeaten, despite this
        the community prevailed and this was actually the first pre 2.8.0 time to be beaten. I am extremely happy to be a part of this movement :)
