        After the 2.8.0 change, Last wish was deemed by many (even the previous record holders) to be unbeatable. LW was famous for being the run that required the most skill so myself along with two players, roen and sunami.
        
        decided to set out and try and beat it. Four months later, we beat the previous run by one whole second (fml).

        Despite it only being one second, this was still a monumental achievment, one that required a lot more than the six players within the raid's contribution. It took ideas from hundreds of players to make it possible.
        Since then roen and sunami have actually went on to be majorly successful speedrunners in other games. Sunami currently holds some records in Super Mario Sunshine and roen has held multiple in Elden Ring.
