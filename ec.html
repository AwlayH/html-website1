        The other two players in this run, Sequ and Crysis, were apart of a group that only contained maybe 6 players in the world. These 6 players are whom I consider to be, at the time, the best 6 in Destiny.
      
        At this time in Destiny's lifespan, grandmaster nightfalls were still considered relatively fresh. They were leaps and bounds ahead in the difficulty we were used to so to think there were players out there breezing through it as fast as possible was some feat.
        
        Luckily, Sequ and Crysis' teammate had to pull out due to focussing on work and school, so they picked me up. This began a very long and fruitful friendship with my italian friends.

        Due to their nature of difficulty, a speedrunning category hadn't even been setup yet as there were only less than 10 players in the game considered good enough to do such a thing. So we set out to what we hoped would  pioneer a new way to play the game. This was the first of many runs with this team.
