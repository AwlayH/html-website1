    <h1>This is a List of All of my Speedrunning Times!
    </h1>

    <p>
        For multiple years myself, along with players from all over the world, attempted to beat raids within Destiny 2 in the fastest time possible, known as speedrunning. We did so under the name "Silimar".
    <br>
        This is a list of just some of the world records I managed to obtain in my time competing! I contribute to a larger number of runs so these are just some of my favourites.
    <br> 
        I have since stopped competing due to limitted free time however it remains a very passionate hobby. Here is a link to my profile that contains all of my previous records (they have since been beaten) :

            <strong>Raids</strong>
            (6 player activities)
            <br> These are activities with complex mechanics usually requiring all 6 player's contribution to progres the level.

        <li> 
            <p>
                <a href="cos.html">Crown of Sorrow 9:25

                </a>, my first ever world record way back in july of 2020, This took us around a month to get.
            
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="gos.html">Garden of Salvation 12:28

                </a> , this run actually only took us 4 days and is the fastest time taken to obtain a record in history.

            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="lw.html">Last Wish 17:50

                </a>, unlike the previous run, this run actually took the second longest ever time to obtain a record. 
            </p>

            <strong>
                Grandmaster Nightfalls
            </strong>
            (3 player activities)
        
            <br>
            These are activities with less mechanics and more enemy intensity requriing all three player's teamwork to be perfect.
