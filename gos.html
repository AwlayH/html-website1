        At this point in my speedrunning career I had started to make a name for myself and I think this run kind of solidified my group's position. I still recall on this time fondly as the most fun I have had running anything. 
        We just had a blast and got the time in only 4 days, i will always say this is the most fun I have had in Destiny.

            Since then GoS has been heavily trivialised and is far far shorter with the current record sitting at 6:58, almost half our time. This run was actually completed with a few members of Silimar so technically we still have it :D
